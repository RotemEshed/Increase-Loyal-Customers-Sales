What is Machine Learning - IN ACTION

There has been a lot of noise around Machine Learning (ML). The truth is that it has been around for decades (since the 1950s to be exact and even some machine learning/ analytical concepts have been developed more than 100 years ago). Arthur Samuel, the person who popularized the term Machine Learning, defined ML back in 1959 as the “field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programed.” So, what exactly does it mean for a machine to “learn” something and act based on that “knowledge?”

In the paper attached, I will try to explain exactly that by suggesting a solution using ML to a real business challenge of how we can use ML to increase sales generated from loyal customers. In reality, IBM was hired by the Company to solve that challenge and I am not aware of their solution. IBM might have used all, some, or none of the models suggested in the paper. Note that the paper is meant for the “unfamiliar” reader and all models/ algorithms are clearly explained and coded (in Python) from scratch for better understanding (however, some basic math/ stats knowledge would help).

Hope you enjoy it.
